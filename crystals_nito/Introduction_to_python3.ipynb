    "Python is a widely used, open source programming language developed by Guido van Rossum. It was first released in 1991. Python is a great language for beginner programmers because it was designed with the newcomer in mind. Python was designed to be readable and it has a simple and consistent syntax. Additionally, Python has a very extensive section of mathematical and scientific libraries. These libraries contain code that has already been written to perform specific tasks so you just need to know how to call the library rather than write the code itself. Lastly, Python is free.\n",

Variables cannot have spaces in their names so dePaula is an acceptable variable, but de Paula is not. Variables are case-sensitive, so x is a different variable than X. There are a number of words, such as print, that Python has reserved for special purposes; you cannot name your variable any of these reserved words.

    "We got started on this endeavor of making arrays because we wanted to plot $y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ from $x = -5$ to $x = 5$. Python has a function, conveniently called plot, which makes 2-D plots. The basic syntax of the plot function is (x,y,formatstring). So the first argument is for the horizontal axis, the second argument is for the vertical axis, and the formatstring argument will let you format your plot. For instance, if you want red circle markers you would type 'ro'. The cell below plots $y = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d$ from $x = -5$ to $x = 5$ as a magenta dash-dot line, and labels the x and y axes. Try it!  \n",
