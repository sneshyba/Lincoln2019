    "Python is a widely used, open source programming language developed by Guido van Rossum. It was first released in 1991. Python is a great language for beginner programmers because it was designed with the newcomer in mind. Python was designed to be readable and it has a simple and consistent syntax. Additionally, Python has a very extensive section of mathematical and scientific libraries. These libraries contain code that has already been written to perform specific tasks so you just need to know how to call the library rather than write the code itself. Lastly, Python is free.\n",

There are a number of words, such as print, that Python has reserved for special purposes; you cannot name your variable any of these reserved words.

We would need to calculate $y$ at a sufficient number of points (~20) for our plot to be smooth. It would be tedious to input 20 different values of $x$ and perform the calculation one-by-one.
